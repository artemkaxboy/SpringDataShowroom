# Customized Repository

This package shows how to create and use repository with custom functions.

1. [Spring-style](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.custom-implementations) implementation can be seen in `springstyle/repository`
2. Extensions-style implementation can be seen in `extensions/repository`. All additional functions store in the same repository file. It is more isolated and easier to maintain.
